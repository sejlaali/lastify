# LASTify

## Introduction
LASTify is a React app that previews songs based on a user's search, by either artist or song title. Users are also able to read artist bios. I used Last.fm's API for the search results and iTunes' API for the music player that previews the songs.

## Technologies:
* React.js <br/>
* React-router <br/>
* Last.fm API <br/>
* iTunes API <br/>
* Materialize.js <br/>
